Issue:     click plugins / cache / local datastore

    Hi,

    Hope u are all well !

    Was wondering if adding click's plugins or pluggy as a feature for ghutil was on your roadmap. It would allow to be non-intrusive for some external plugins if we could define a plugin registry via a yaml file.

    From my perspective, I just wanted to extend the use of some ghutil "repos" related command (eg. repos starred) and to append some meta-data (mainly in Json/YAML format) from different sources:

    Additional info from github api:
    - Add topics for any repo related queries
    - Add readme for starred repo for indexation
    - Add files list per branch for making faster any source code sifting, pattern matching

    examples of plugins for a cached registry of enhanced meta data:
    - https://github.com/thombashi/ghscard (mainly to build a chrome extension and some hover cards"
    - https://github.com/asciimoo/searx
    - https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit
    - https://github.com/GitMarkTeam/gitmark
    - https://github.com/douban/linguist
    - https://github.com/porter-io/tagg-python

    Ideally, I wanted to complete a **ghutil** with a local datastore, sqlite or mysql, and, later on, I will had some classifiers on gh topics attributes with gensim/elastic search but that's another milestone ^^.

    Any feedback or inputs are welcomed, have a great day !

    Cheers,
    Richard

    I do not currently have any plans for supporting plugins, and any such plans would be very far down on my to-do list for this project.

    We'd like to be able to put paths to gerrit reviews in requirements files.

    Given a gerrit like https://review.openstack.org/#/c/345601/6, the path given for a git pull looks like:

       git pull https://git.openstack.org/openstack/oslo.db refs/changes/01/345601/6

    pip syntax we'd expect would be:

    ```
    .venv/bin/pip install -e git+https://git.openstack.org/openstack/oslo.db@refs/changes/01/345601/6#egg=oslo.db
    ```

    current output:

    ```
