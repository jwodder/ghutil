- starring & watching repositories
    - <https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/starring/>
- creating pull requests
- Use <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/giturlparse.py>?
- When creating a new release, prepopulate the release message/body with the
  tagged commit's commit message
- Make `release` use `edit_as_mail`
- `edit`: Allow the user to specify the repository on the command line
- Rename `gist` and/or `gists` so that they're not so similar
