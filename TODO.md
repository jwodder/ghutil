- Add docstrings to everything
- Instead of assuming the GitHub remote for a local repository is always
  "origin", get all remotes with `git config --get-regexp 'remote\..*\.url'`
  and check for one that's a GitHub URL?
- Write more tests (somehow)
    - Somewhere test that credentials are being redacted from cassettes
    - Test that the correct User-Agent and Accept headers are being sent?
    - Test that calling `Repository.default_params()` when `get_remote_url()`
      returns a local path always fails
    - `--verbose`
    - Specifying an issue, PR, or release without a repository name, with
      `get_remote_url()` mocked
    - `show`ing more than one object at once

API Completeness
================
- Repositories:
    - watching
    - showing subscribers?
        - Are subscribers already listed by the /repos/:owner/:repo/subscribers
          endpoint despite the documentation saying it lists watchers?  If so,
          how are watchers fetched?
    - deleting branches
    - protecting branches
    - editing all options
    - editing topics

- Issues & pull requests:
    - comments
        - showing individual comments as JSON?
        - editing comments
    - more reactions

        - review comments
    - merging PRs
    - assigning
    - labelling & milestones
    - editing
    - closing

    - deleting
    - adding, editing, & deleting release assets

- Gists:
    - forking
    - listing forks

  instead of names
- Give the `list` and `search` (and `starred`?) subcommands `--format` options

- `gh repo`:
    - Give `new` an option for setting the local repository's origin to the new
      repository and pushing everything to it
    - Give `fork` (and `new`?) an option for cloning the new repository
