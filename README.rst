The ``ghutil`` package provides a command-line program for interacting with &
managing GitHub repositories, issues, gists, etc.

This is a work in progress; while the program should be usable at any given
point in time, many API features are not yet present, and those features that
are present may have their interface modified at any time.


Installation
============
``ghutil`` requires Python 3.7 or higher to run and `pip
<https://pip.pypa.io>`_ 19.0 or higher to install.  You can install ``ghutil``
and its dependencies by running::

    python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/jwodder/ghutil.git


Basic Usage
===========

Authentication
--------------

Create a ``~/.config/ghutil.cfg`` file and store a GitHub token in it like so::
