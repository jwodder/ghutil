The ``ghutil`` package provides a command-line program for interacting with &
managing GitHub repositories, issues, gists, etc.

This is a work in progress; while the program should be usable at any given
point in time, many API features are not yet present, and those features that
are present may have their interface modified at any time.


Installation
============
``ghutil`` requires Python 3.4 or higher to run and `pip
<https://pip.pypa.io>`_ 6.0+, `Setuptools <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io>`_
30.3.0+, & `wheel <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wheel>`_ to install.  `Once you
have those
<https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#install-pip-setuptools-and-wheel>`_,
you can install ``ghutil`` and its dependencies by running::

    python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/jwodder/ghutil.git


Basic Usage
===========

Authentication
--------------
Store your GitHub username & password in ``~/.netrc`` like so::

    machine api.github.com
    login YOUR_USERNAME_HERE
    password YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE

(Make sure the file permissions on ``~/.netrc`` are set to 0600!)

Alternatively, create a ``~/.config/ghutil.cfg`` file and populate it with
either your username & password::

    [api.auth]
    username = YOUR_USERNAME_HERE
    password = YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE

or an OAuth2 token::

    [api.auth]
    token = YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN_HERE
